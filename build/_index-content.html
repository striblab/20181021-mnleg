        <p>Control of Minnesota’s Legislature tends to blow with the up-ballot winds, due in large part to a couple dozen swing seats in greater Minnesota and the Twin Cities suburbs.</p>
        
        <p>During presidential election years, the winner's party tends to ride those victorious coattails to a legislative majority. Inversely, midterms usually result in backlashes against the majority party and the pendulum swings back the other way.</p>

      <p>This November's midterm could be positioned to follow past trends, since the <span class="d4 legendary">DFL</span> only needs to flip 11 seats from <span class="r3 legendary">GOP</span> control to retake the Legislature.</p>

      <p>The Star Tribune has analyzed these races and isolated which contests to watch most closely on Election Night.</p>

      <p>In a chamber of 134 seats, 68 are needed to hold a majority, which Republicans have with 77 seats compared to 57 Democrats.</p>

      <p>By one measure, 14 out of 17 competitive seats are held by the GOP, according to a Star Tribune analysis using the Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI), which rates each district's political lean and competitiveness.</p>

        <p>CPVI was developed by The Cook Political Report to score political lean of U.S. House races by comparing the average party votes of the past two presidential elections to district-level election results.</p>

        <p>But this is only one way to examine a race's competitiveness, and in Minnesota's Legislative contests, where polling is sparse and rare, other aspects are needed to further isolate the hottest races.</p>

        <p>Additionally, there are 23 open seats in the chamber where incumbents are not seeking reelection, several rematches of 2016 races and a handful of uncontested districts.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Watching the rural and suburban votes</h2>
      <p>Minnesota's urban/rural political divide became even more geographically pronounced after 2016, and the most competitive legislative races are in areas that have shifted their political alignment the most over time.</p>

      <p>Districts in Minnesota's Iron Range and Southern Minnesota — traditionally Democratic strongholds — voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016. Inversely, many suburban districts that often vote Republican were won by Hillary Clinton by large margins.</p>

      <p>It's no accident that those regions are home to major battleground districts in the U.S. House of Representatives as well. How those races swing in November may affect the outcomes of these competitive legislative districts.</p>

      <p>Of course, statewide elections could also have an effect, particularly depending upon whether gubernatorial and senatorial candidates from either party can shore-up a geographically diverse enough coalition to win.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">Watching for presidential effects</h2>
      <p>Just as control of the U.S. House of Representatives seems closely tied to presidential approval ratings, similar trends have been found in Minnesota's legislative races.</p>

      <p>In fact, in the last 40 years, the American president's party hasn't gained a single seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives.</p>

    <section class="container-lg">
      <p>National polling averages show President Donald Trump at a 42 percent job approval rating, while <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-senate-poll-star-tribune-mpr-news-tina-smith-karin-housley-amy-klobuchar-jim-newberger/493635631/">a recent Star Tribune/MPR News Minnesota Poll</a> has him at 39 percent in Minnesota.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the midterm's referrendum on President Trump's performance will strongly affect Minnesota's House races remains to be seen, but if it does, it would be in line with previous trends.</p>

      <h2 class="chartTitle">What about the Minnesota Senate?</h2>
      <p>As for the Minnesota Senate, there's only one race this year – in District 13, in the central part of the state – to decide which party controls the chamber.</p>

      <p>The split in Minnesota's Senate is tied at 33 Democrats and 33 Republicans, with one vacancy left by Michelle Fischbach (R), who is now the outgoing lieutenant governor.</p>

      <p>This special election between Jeff Howe (R) and Joe Perske (DFL) is in a heavily Republican Senate district comprised of legislative districts 13A and 13B, which respectively have CPVI scores of R+16 and R+17.</p>

      <p>So while this isn't a reelection year for the Minnesota Senate, a pivotal race puts its balance of power on the table in November, giving each parties a chance to cement control over both state legislative chambers.</p>
