      <h1>What to watch for in Minnesota's legislative races this year</h1>

      <p>Republicans have a chance to run Minnesota's government – including the governorship, Minnesota House of Representitives and Minnesota Senate – for the first time in 40 years this November.</p>

      <p>The GOP already has majorities in the state's legislative chambers: by 20 seats in the House and one in the Senate.</p>

      <p>But control of the Legislature tends to blow with the up-ballot winds, due in large part to a couple dozen swing seats in greater Minnesota and the Twin Cities suburbs.</p>
      
      <p>During presidential election years, the winner's party tends to ride victorious coattails to a legislative majority. Inversely, midterms usually result in backlashes against the majority party and the pendulum swings back the other way.</p>

        <p>This gives hope to Democrats, as November's midterm could be positioned to follow past trends since the <span class='d4 legendary'>DFL</span> only needs to flip 11 seats from <span class='r3 legendary'>GOP</span> control to retake the House.</p>

        <p>As for the Minnesota Senate, there's only one special race this year, in District 13 betwee Jeff Howe (R) and Joe Perske (DFL) to fill the vacancy left by outgoing Lt. Gov. Michelle Fischbach (R) and decide which party breaks the 33-to-33 tie and takes the chamber.</p>
  
        <p>The Star Tribune has analyzed these races and isolated which legislative contests to watch most closely on Election Night.</p>

        <p>In a chamber of 134 seats, 68 are needed to hold a majority, which Republicans have with 77 seats compared to 57 Democrats.</p>

        <p>Polling is rare in Minnesota's legislative contests, so a combination of measures are needed to isolate how competitive each race is. Looking at each district's partisan voting trends and the last presidential election results can be revealing.</p>

        <p>Districts in areas that <span class="legendary gray2">favored the opposing party's presidential candidate</span> or had really close margins in 2016 could be primed for flipping party control.</p>

          <p>A Star Tribune analysis shows seven DFL-held seats in districts won by Donald Trump in 2016, versus 12 GOP-held seats in districts won by Hillary Clinton.</p>

          <p>Additional seats that might be worth watching may be among the 23 open seats without incumbents this year, or one of the 13 rematches between the same candidates from two years ago.</p>

          <p>Part of these rankings includes using the Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI), which rates each district's political lean and competitiveness by comparing the average party votes of the past two presidential elections to district-level election results. Another part includes rating races based on the margins President Trump won or lost by in 2016.</p>

          <p>The special election for the District 13 Senate seat is in a heavily-Republican area as well and is home to House districts 13A and 13B, which voted for Trump by large margins in 2016 and have CPVI scores of R+15 and R+17, respectively.</p>

        <p>Geography also matters in these races, especially since Minnesota's urban/rural political divide became even more pronounced after 2016's election.</p>
  
        <p>Districts in Minnesota's Iron Range and Southern Minnesota — traditionally Democratic strongholds — voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016. Inversely, many suburban districts that often vote Republican were won by Hillary Clinton by significant margins.</p>

        <p>It's no accident that those regions are home to <a href="http://www.startribune.com/why-you-ll-be-hearing-so-much-about-minnesota-s-congressional-races-this-fall/483225921">major battleground districts in the U.S. House of Representatives as well</a>. How those races swing in November may affect the outcomes of these competitive legislative districts.</p>

        <p>Of course, statewide elections could also have an effect, particularly depending upon whether gubernatorial and senatorial candidates from either party can shore-up a geographically diverse enough coalition to win.</p>
  
        <p>And just as control of the U.S. House of Representatives seems closely tied to presidential approval ratings, similar trends have been found in Minnesota's legislative races.</p>
        
        <p>National polling averages show President Donald Trump at a 42 percent job approval rating, while <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-senate-poll-star-tribune-mpr-news-tina-smith-karin-housley-amy-klobuchar-jim-newberger/493635631/">a recent Star Tribune/MPR News Minnesota Poll</a> has him at 39 percent in Minnesota.</p>
