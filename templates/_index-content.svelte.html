      <p>Republicans have a chance to fully control Minnesota's government – including the governorship, Minnesota House of Representitives and Minnesota Senate – for the first time in 40 years this November.</p>

      <p>The GOP already has slim majorities in the state's legislative chambers: by 10 seats in the House and one in the Senate.</p>

      <p>But control of the Legislature tends to blow with the up-ballot winds, due in large part to a couple dozen swing seats in greater Minnesota and the Twin Cities suburbs.</p>
      
      <p>During presidential election years, the winner's party tends to ride those victorious coattails to a legislative majority. Inversely, midterms usually result in backlashes against the majority party and the pendulum swings back the other way.</p>

        <p>This gives hope to Democrats, as November's midterm could be positioned to follow past trends since the <span class='d4 legendary'>DFL</span> only needs to flip 11 seats from <span class='r3 legendary'>GOP</span> control to retake the House.</p>

        <p>As for the Minnesota Senate, there's only one special race this year, in District 13 betwee Jeff Howe (R) and Joe Perske (DFL) to fill the vacancy left by outgoing Lt. Gov. Michelle Fischbach (R) and decide which party breaks the 33-to-33 tie and controls the chamber.</p>
  
        <p>The Star Tribune has analyzed these races and isolated which contests to watch most closely on Election Night.</p>

        <h2 class="chartTitle">Rating Minnesota's legislative races</h2>
        <p>In a chamber of 134 seats, 68 are needed to hold a majority, which Republicans have with 77 seats compared to 57 Democrats.</p>

        <p>Polling is rare in Minnesota's legislative contests, so a combination of measures are needed to isolate how competitive each race is.</p>

        <p>By one measure, 14 out of 17 competitive seats are held by the GOP, according to a Star Tribune analysis using the Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI), which rates each district's political lean and competitiveness.</p>

          <p>CPVI was developed by The Cook Political Report to score political lean of U.S. House races by comparing the average party votes of the past two presidential elections to district-level election results.</p>

          <p>Additionally, there are 23 open seats in the chamber where incumbents are not seeking reelection, several rematches of 2016 races and a handful of uncontested districts.</p>

        <h2 class="chartTitle">Watching the rural and suburban votes</h2>
        <p>Minnesota's urban/rural political divide became even more geographically pronounced after 2016.</p>
  
        <p>Districts in Minnesota's Iron Range and Southern Minnesota — traditionally Democratic strongholds — voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016. Inversely, many suburban districts that often vote Republican were won by Hillary Clinton by significant margins.</p>

        <p>It's no accident that those regions are home to <a href="http://www.startribune.com/why-you-ll-be-hearing-so-much-about-minnesota-s-congressional-races-this-fall/483225921">major battleground districts in the U.S. House of Representatives as well</a>. How those races swing in November may affect the outcomes of these competitive legislative districts.</p>

        <p>Of course, statewide elections could also have an effect, particularly depending upon whether gubernatorial and senatorial candidates from either party can shore-up a geographically diverse enough coalition to win.</p>
  
        <p>And just as control of the U.S. House of Representatives seems closely tied to presidential approval ratings, similar trends have been found in Minnesota's legislative races.</p>
        
        <p>National polling averages show President Donald Trump at a 42 percent job approval rating, while <a href="http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-senate-poll-star-tribune-mpr-news-tina-smith-karin-housley-amy-klobuchar-jim-newberger/493635631/">a recent Star Tribune/MPR News Minnesota Poll</a> has him at 39 percent in Minnesota.</p>
